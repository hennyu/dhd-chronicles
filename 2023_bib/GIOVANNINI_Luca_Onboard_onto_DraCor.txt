                            https://dracor.org. In the context of CLS INFRA (
                            https://clsinfra.io), DraCor has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 program (grant agreement No. 101004984).
                        
                    

                         Both corpora are still a work in progress. For review, the two corpora can (as public alpha) be accessed in the corresponding GitHub repositories 
                            https://github.com/dracor-org/epdracor and 
                            https://github.com/dracor-org/udracor. Both corpora will be published as public beta in the context of DHd2023.
